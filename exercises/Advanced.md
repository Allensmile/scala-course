## Practical exercises

### 1. Playing with Cats

* [Cats](http://typelevel.org/cats/) is one of many useful libraries that we haven't had time to explore properly in this short course. [Scala exercises](https://www.scala-exercises.org/) has some [Cats exercises](https://www.scala-exercises.org/cats) which are worth working through to learn a little about how it works.

### 2. Simulacrum for typeclass programming

* [Simulacrum](https://github.com/mpilquist/simulacrum) is another useful library for FP in Scala. Read about how it works and then re-do the `CsvRow` and `Thinnable` typeclass examples from the notes using Simulacrum. Note how much cleaner they are. Note that Cats has a dependence on Simulacrum, so if you have a project or REPL with a Cats dependency you do not need to add an additional dependence on Simulacrum.

### 3. Probabilistic programming with Figaro

* [Figaro](https://github.com/p2t2/figaro) is a library for probabilistic programming in Scala. Use the remaining time to read through the [Quick start guide](https://github.com/p2t2/figaro/raw/master/doc/Figaro%20Quick%20Start%20Guide.pdf) and then skim the [Tutorial](https://www.cra.com/sites/default/files/pdf/Figaro_Tutorial.pdf). Try to build and run the example from the quick start guide.
