# Statistical modelling

## Practical exercises

### 1. Linear regression modelling

* Run the [regression example](../examples/C6-Regression/) for the [yacht hydrodynamics dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Yacht+Hydrodynamics), and go through the code carefully to understand exactly how it works. 
* When you are happy with it, make a copy and edit it to do a regression analysis for the [airfoil self-noise dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Airfoil+Self-Noise). Which variables are significant for predicting scaled sound pressure?

### 2. IRLS optimisation
