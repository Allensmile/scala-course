# Scala and FP basics

## Practical exercises

Exercises following the material presented in Chapter 2

### 1. LogFactorial example

Find and run the complete log-factorial example using SBT, using `run` from the SBT prompt. Pass in an argument using, eg. `run 1000`. Next, drop into the REPL with `console`. Then enter
```scala
import LogFact._
logfact(100)
```
So we can use the SBT REPL to run functions within our project. This is extremely useful for debugging.
