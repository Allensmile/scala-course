It will save time during the course if everyone sets up their laptop with some essential required software in advance of the course. The basic requirements are:

* Download and install a recent version of Java (ideally Java 8), but OpenJDK is fine
* Download and install "sbt"
* Install a Scala-aware editor or IDE
* Download (but don't need to install) Apache Spark
